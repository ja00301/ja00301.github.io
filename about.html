<h2> Why Was This Website Created? </h2>
<p> I made this website because of my love for animals. I live with horses, dogs, chickens, and cats, but I love all types of animals. When I was younger, my parents took me on a trip across the country in a RV. I saw moose, bears, elk, muskox, and many other unique animals of the North American landscape. I also saw glacier retention due to global warming and realized these beautiful animals are at risk of habitat loss in our lifetime. Global warming is affecting our Earth in realtime and it seems that we go on like nothing is happening. I chose to learn more about extinct and endangered animals and spread the knowledge with this website. Thank you for reading through the website and spending your time learning a thing or two.
