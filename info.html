	<h2> Most Famous Extinct Animals </h2>
	<h3> Dinosaurs <h3>
	<p> The term 'Dinosaurs' refers to a large, diverse group of animals that ranged from small bird-like animals to gigantic species that are larger than any land animal today.
	the most notable species include the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Brachiosaurus, Velocirapter, Triceratops, and Pterodactylus. Dinosaurs are very common in media from Jurassic Park
	to kids shows like Dinosaur Train. Dinosaurs are assumed to have gone extinct from an asteroid impact that affected the globe. </p>

	<h3> Woolly Mammoth </h3>
	<p> Woolly Mammoths were a large, hairy, ancestor of the elephant we know and love today. They lived during the Ice Age and adapted to the cold temperatures with their
	thick fur. Woolly Mammoths are speculated to have roamed the tundra 300,000 years ago to roughly 1650 B.C.. The exact reason for their extinction is unknown, but 
	scientists have two theories. Either humans hunted them to extinction, or they could not handle the change towards a warmer climate. </p>

	<h3> Dodo Bird </h3>
	<p> The Dodo was a flightless bird that lived on the Island of Mauritius. These birds have a very unique look, with a plump body, large beak, and small wings. They were 
	first found by Portuguese sailors around 1507, and soon after their discovery they were hunted. Humans also introduced invasive species to their island which harmed 
	their local ecosystem. The Dodo bird is one of the most well known examples of an animal lead to extinction by humans.
